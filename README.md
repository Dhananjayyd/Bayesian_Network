# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to calculate the probability of a hypothesis based on the evidence available.

The basic idea behind Naive Bayes is to calculate the probability of each possible label for a given input, based on the conditional probabilities of each feature given each label. The label with the highest probability is then chosen as the predicted label for the input.

Naive Bayes can be trained on labeled data, where the input is a set of features and the label is the desired output. During training, the algorithm calculates the conditional probabilities for each feature given each label. Then, during prediction, it uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of each label given the input features, and chooses the label with the highest probability.
